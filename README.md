## Possible errors

avrdude: stk500_getsync()
#Possible fix: Change the processor to ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)

**NOTE: We have updated the NANO board with a fresh bootloader. Boards sold from us from January 2018 have this new bootloader, while boards manufactured before that date have the old bootloader. To program old boards you need to choose Processor > "ATmega328P (Old Bootloader)".**
